ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mahad!

I am a dedicated student at McMaster University pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Eng hoping to get my Master's soon after. I have constantly motivated and disciplined myself to gain more knowledge of the software world by learning new languages and using them to create more and more compelling personal projects. 

Feel free to reach me at mahadhassan375@gmail.com if you would like to connect, send me project ideas, or even become friends!
